# Heart-Disease-classification
The data set contains information of patients suffering through heart disease. Here in this project model is built to identify whether the patient survived or not. 

Different types of algorithms are used to generate the model and KNN algorithm is finalized as a model of the given data set.

As the problem is for classification whether the patient survived or not so this is binary classifier problem. So, project includes models built on Logistic Regression, Decision Tree classifier, KNN, Random Forest Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier and XGBoost Classifier.
